Recently I encountered an interesting problem with a Kafka consumer group in a large enterprise setting. Like many issues, it only became truly challenging once we had to solve it within the constraints of the environment.

## The Problem
A consumer repeatedly throwing `org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException` exception while trying to read messages from a topic. Upon investigation, I discovered that the messages being sent to this topic were much larger than usual. A third-party publisher was sending messages at the wrong granularity—rather than the expected 50KB aggregated messages, they were publishing much larger unaggregated, 1MB messages.

### The Root Cause
These oversized messages couldn't be processed within the configured `max.timeout.ms` window. As a result consumers in the group failed to commit offsets and threw timeout exceptions. This created a bottleneck: new messages coudln't be processed, and the lag started growing.

Since discarding the messages outright wasn’t an option—at least, not initially—I looked for possible configuration changes to mitigate the issue:
- Increase `max.timeout.ms`: Give the consumer more time to process a batch of messages.
- Decrease `max.fetch.records`: Reduce the nmuber of message per batch.
- Send large messages to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) and handle them separately later.

Simple enough, right? _Not so fast_...

## The Constraints
Before tweaking configurations, we had to consider the constraints of our production environment.

### Config Changes Affect Multiple Services
The configs applied to this consumer group are also applied to a suite of related consumer groups. Any change needed to be safe across all services. Increasing `max.timeout.ms` would delay consumer failure detection and consumer group rebalances. Decreasing `max.fetch.records` could reduce throughput and increase network overhead.

### Production Environment Limitations
Code changes in production are rarely welcomed. While adding a simple check for message size in the error handler would have been an easy fix, such changes weren’t permitted at the time.

I proceeded cautiously, gradually increasing `max.timeout.ms` and decreasing `max.fetch.records`. This resulted in consumers fetching half the original batch size and doubling their processing time. Still, it wasn’t enough. We were stuck.

## Finding Another Config
Reevaluating the approach, I realized that the best way to make more aggressive changes was to ensure they didn’t negatively impact healthy services.

When a consumer fetches messages, Kafka applies multiple configs:
- `max.partition.fetch.bytes` **(Default: 1MB)**: The maximum bytes fetched from each partition. However, the total fetched across all partitions cannot exceed .
- `fetch.max.bytes` **(Default: 50MB)**: The maximum bytes fetched across all partitions.
- `max.fetch.records` **(Defaults)**: Ensure the batch does not exceed a set number of records.

In our scenario, each consumer was assigned a single partiton. This meant that `fetch.max.bytes` effectively behaved like `max.partition.fetch.bytes`.

After a quick survey of the other services using the shared config, I found they all processed small messages. Their throughput depended on the number of records fetched, not the byte size. This meant I could significantly reduce `fetch.max.bytes` across all services without affecting their performance. Was this my silver bullet?

## Sometimes You Win...
... sometimes you learn. As it turned out, the default Kafka configurations were already enforcing the retrieval semantics I was trying to achieve. The consumer group was already fetching one large message at a time. Besides, even if we could process these large messages, the lag would take weeks to process at this rate. 

Our final lever? The good old `kafka-consumer-groups` tool with the ominous `--reset-offset` flag. The messages were discarded, and the publisher informed.

## Lessons Learned
This issue reinforced some valuable lessons about Kafka operations:
- Understanding how Kafka configurations interact is crucial for effective troubleshooting.
- Shared configurations complicate problem-solving, requiring careful consideration.

Even with all the levers Kafka offers to fine-tune our client behavior, some issues lie beyond the reach of our configs and need to be fixed upstream.
