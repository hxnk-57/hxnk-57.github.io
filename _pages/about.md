Welcome! I’m a data engineer with a deep passion for data streaming and its ecosystem. This blog is my space to document my journey—diving into both the complex and the trivial parts of data engineering. Rather than step-by-step tutorials, I focus on the "why" and the "why not" behind different concepts, architectures, and decisions. Expect a glimpse at the good, the bad, and the ugly of working with data at scale.
